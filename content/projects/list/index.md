My personal projects, in various states of completion:  
- If the link redirects here, this means I haven't written the project page yet.
- A few of them are Instructables.com tutorials, so I'll just link directly to that.

Audio
-----

- [GuitarFM](../guitarfm) : An FM transmitter that you plug into an electric guitar

- [Fvpedal]({{<ref "/projects/list">}}) : A Guitar pedal with a Spinsemi FV-1 DSP, two effect banks & an attiny uC


Wearables
---------

- [ledwatch](../ledwatch) : A wristwatch with an MSP430 uC, a 3x8 led matrix and an accelerometer. Programmed in bare-metal C.

- [M-watch]({{<ref "/projects/list">}}) : A smarter follow-up to the ledwatch, with a nRF52 BLE SoC and a modular front/back panel system. Uses apache mynewt or Zephyr RTOS.


Robotics & RC
-------------

- [Balbot]({{<ref "/projects/list">}}) : A two-wheel self-stabilizing robot

- [WifiStunt](https://www.instructables.com/id/WiFi-Stunt-Car/) : A smartphone-controlled RC stunt car (accelerometer + wifi). Bit of a easier follow-up to [AndRC](https://www.instructables.com/id/Android-RC-Car/)


Other
-----

- [Pd-imu]({{<ref "/projects/list">}}) : A school project to develop a real-time remote inertial motion graphing system (Puredata & nRF24)

- [SuperOctogon]({{<ref "/projects/list">}}) : A super-hexagon clone to be played with a remote accelerometer (from the pd-imu project)

- [Wthermo]({{<ref "/projects/list">}}) : A school project to make a remote-controlled thermostat (Labview & zigbee)


High school
-----------

Projects from back when I was in high school:

- [N-heli](https://www.instructables.com/id/Nunchuk-controlled-Helicopter/) : Reverse-engineering a RC heli IR protocol and controlling it with a Wii nunchuk

- [AndRC](https://www.instructables.com/id/Android-RC-Car/) : A smartphone gesture controlled RC car

- [Crawl-bot-1](../crawlbot1) : My very first robot for a french competition (which failed miserably)

- [Crawl-bot-2](https://www.instructables.com/id/Joystick-controlled-Robot/) : My second robot for the same competition (which failed a bit less miserably, but still). Controlled with an Xbox360 controller and a simple python script
